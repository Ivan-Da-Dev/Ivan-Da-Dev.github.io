{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"a certain magical index","rating":9,"review":"I have finished **all** seasons about A Certain Magical Index. I LOVED IT, it has action, comedy and harem. Not only that but it has adventure too (now you're concept of adventure might be different than mine, adventure in my mind means going to places), every time I look back at this anime, it makes me feel nostalgic. This anime was always entertaining me during quarantine. Tho the reason why I gave it a 9 was because of Index, shes fucking useless but shes fucking funny and cute too. So shes a good character when it comes to anything other than fighting, shes a good support, knowledgeable, annoying, cute and lazy","genres":["magic","comedy","action","harem"],"img":"index_img.jpg","bg":"index_bg.jpg","desc":"\n    The story is set in Academy City (学園都市, Gakuen Toshi), a technologically advanced independent city-state located in the west of Tokyo known for its educational and research institutions. Tōma Kamijō is a student in Academy City whose right hand, the Imagine Breaker, has the ability to negate any supernatural power, but also negates his own luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Tōma meets a young English girl named Index – a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind has been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum – 103,000 forbidden magical books that the Church has stored in secret locations. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Tōma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Sorcerers and Espers in Academy City who try to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Tōma's own special power.\n\n    Besides its own manga adaptation, the series also has two manga series which are side stories focusing on other main characters. One of them is A Certain Scientific Railgun, which focuses on Mikoto Misaka, an Electromaster and one of the most powerful Espers in the city. The second, A Certain Scientific Accelerator, focuses on Accelerator, a teenager who can control vectors, known as the most powerful Esper in Academy City.\n    ","alt":["Toaru Majutsu no Index 2","Toaru Majutsu no Kinsho Mokuroku 2"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
