Why? Because the first 5 minutes of the first episode gave me that idea lmao @./asiayn_imouto_naked.jpg@ I was so excited :blush: but then as I watch further, its a normal slice of life anime<br><br>The reason I still kept watching it despite it not being a nude anime, is that it has a perverted cute girl who wants to have sex with her senpai @./asiayn_sniff.jfif@ and that is the reason for why I am alive, not only that but it also has this other cute girl @./asayn_miyako.png@ (shes 21 btw despite having a loli face) and the fan service on this is... @./asiayn_egg_eating.gif@ not to mention I wanna see how the MC reacts when he knows that he had a little sister all along and the plot is not too bad either, in the end when we all thought the MC had a anime adaption for his LN but in reality he is just a replacement","genres":["ecchi","comedy","slice of life","romance","creator's slice of life"],"img":"asayn_img.jpg","bg":"asayn_bg.jpg","desc":"Itsuki Hashima is a light novelist obsessed with little sisters, strictly focusing on them when he writes his stories. Despite his personality, he is surrounded by a tight circle of friends: Nayuta Kani, a genius yet perverted novelist who is in love with him; Haruto Fuwa, a fellow male author whose work has seen considerable success; Miyako Shirakawa, a good friend that he met in college; and Chihiro, his perfect younger step-brother who takes care of the housework and cooking.\n \nTogether, they play strange games, go on spontaneous journeys, crack silly jokes, and celebrate each other's successes. However, each individual must also deal with their own issues, whether it is struggling to meet a deadline or coming to terms with traumatic events buried in their past.","alt":["It'd be Good if Only Little Sister Was Here"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
