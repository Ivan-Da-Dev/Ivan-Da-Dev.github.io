{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"arpeggio of blue steel: ars nova","rating":8,"review":"This anime is good. Tho sadly, a lot of people don't know it's existence. The plot is there are bad battle ships, the MC's battleship is also one of them but she (yes the battle ship is a girl) rebelled against them and obeyed the MC regardless if it means sinking her own former allies. There is some character development for 1-401 @./ars_nova_img.jpg@ this is her, the battleship I mentioned earlier, she has a robot like attitude at first but at the end, when the MC almost freezed to death, she saved him despite the MC told him not to, that's very touching ya know\n\nReason why I gave it a 8 and not a 10? because the MC doesn't end up with 1-401","genres":["science fiction","romance"],"img":"ars_nova_img.jpg","bg":"ars_nova_bg.png","desc":"In the year 2039, the drastic effects of global warming have caused sea levels to rise, resulting in major loss of land.
