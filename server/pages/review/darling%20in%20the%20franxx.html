Children raised here are trained to pilot giant mechas known as FranXX—the only weapons known to be effective against the Klaxosaurs—in boy-girl pairs. Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race.  

Hiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class&#x27; graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where 
he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the &quot;Partner Killer.&quot; Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near 
Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner by his side, Hiro has been given a chance at redemption for his past failures, but at what cost?</h4></div><div class="view_container" id="right"><img id="view_img" src="../review-images/darling_img.jpg"/></div></div><div class="view_container" id="mid"><h1 class="label">Review</h1><h4 class="view_review">This was the first anime that I watched. Half of it was good. 'U sick bastard how can u not enjoy darling in the franxx', well I prefer the 02 that loves to tease the MC but when they maked up at episode 6 or 7 or 8, 02 completely changed from a teaser to a normal girl, I rated it 10 because the plot is very good lmao. I didn't expect 02 and the MC to be giant spaceships and die together in the end. I ALSO DIDN'T EXPECT THOSE 2 KIDS TO HAVE SEX AND HAVE A BABY HOLY FUC- Oh I lost my composure there. I love it how they use the power system, whats a "power system" u ask? For example, 02 has the authority to go wherever she wants and do what she wants. They know what 02 is doing but they can't stop her because shes plays a important role too, I like how 02 keeps saying darling, this <br>anime also feels nostalgic when thinking back</h4></div></div><div class="view_comments"><h1>Comments</h1><div class="article-container"><div shortname="oniichann" config="[object Object]" id="disqus_thread"></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"darling in the franxx","rating":10,"review":"This was the first anime that I watched.
