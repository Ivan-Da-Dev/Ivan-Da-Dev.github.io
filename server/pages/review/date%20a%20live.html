Since then, these quakes have been plaguing the world intermittently, albeit on a lighter scale.

Shidou Itsuka is a seemingly average high school student who lives with his younger sister, Kotori. When an imminent spatial quake threatens the safety of Tengu City, he rushes to save her, only to be caught in the resulting eruption. He discovers a mysterious girl at its source, who is revealed to be a &quot;Spirit,&quot; an otherworldly entity whose appearance triggers a spatial quake. Soon after, he becomes embroiled in a skirmish between the girl and the Anti-Spirit Team, a ruthless strike force with the goal of annihilating Spirits.

However, there is a third party that  believes in saving the spirits: &quot;Ratatoskr,&quot; which surprisingly is commanded by Shidou&#x27;s little sister!  Kotori forcibly recruits Shidou after the clash, presenting to him an alternative method of dealing with the danger posed by the Spirits—make them fall in love with him. Now, the fate of the world rests on his dating prowess, as he seeks out Spirits in order to charm them.</h4></div><div class="view_container" id="right"><img id="view_img" src="../review-images/dal_img.jpg"/></div></div><div class="view_container" id="mid"><h1 class="label">Review</h1><h4 class="view_review">Imagine a anime that makes the MC cheat on his "girlfriends" to save the world, yes, this is that kind of anime<br>
Honestly, the anime is pretty cringy at some times, but hey, if theres cute girls, this means that its a good anime. While I do not know if there will be a 4th season, but there are ALOT of plot holes, such as

How does the spirits come?
Why did Origami fell for shido?
Kurumi's past
where tf is shido's parents?
what is shido? (I mean he can use spirits items and seal spirit's powers)
how did kotori become the fire girl?
what does kotori mean by "I'll kill shido"?
why tf does DEM want to kill the spirits that badly?

If you didn't knew this already, they made 2 movies showing Kurumi's past, but not much, it's called Date a Bullet</h4></div></div><div class="view_comments"><h1>Comments</h1><div class="article-container"><div shortname="oniichann" config="[object Object]" id="disqus_thread"></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"date a live","rating":8,"review":"Imagine a anime that makes the MC cheat on his \"girlfriends\" to save the world, yes, this is that kind of anime\n\nHonestly, the anime is pretty cringy at some times, but hey, if theres cute girls, this means that its a good anime.
