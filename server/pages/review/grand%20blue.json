{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"grand blue","rating":9.5,"review":"This is the best slice of life anime ever. At first I watched this during quarantine because I saw a funny clip on youtube, and boy although the thumbnail of the anime makes u think \"oh this is probaly related to diving\", well NOPE. Although it may look like a diving related anime but the anime is 10% about diving and 90% about naked men drinking. They did a perfect job of adding slice of life and comedy together, the art style just tops it all, they draw really contrasted faces when its comedy time lmao for example: @./gb_shocked.jpg@ which makes it 100 times funnier","genres":["slice of life","comedy"],"img":"gb_img.jpg","bg":"gb_bg.png","desc":"Iori Kitahara moves to the coastal town of Izu for his freshman year at its university, taking residence above Grand Blue, his uncle's scuba diving shop.

Persuaded by upperclassmen Shinji Tokita and Ryuujirou Kotobuki, Iori reluctantly joins their bizarre party. His cousin Chisa Kotegawa later walks in and catches him in the act, earning Iori her utter disdain.\n\nBased on Kenji Inoue and Kimitake Yoshioka's popular comedy manga, Grand Blue follows Iori's misadventures with his eccentric new friends as he strives to realize his ideal college dream, while also learning how to scuba dive.","alt":[""]}},"__N_SSG":true}
