Within the city lives Naomi Katagaki, a socially awkward and introverted boy with a love for books, and Ruri Ichigyou, a girl with a cold personality who is often blunt with people, but shares his love for reading. Despite having similar interests, Naomi is afraid to approach Ruri due to her unfriendly nature.

One day, as Naomi goes out for a walk, a crimson aurora pierces through the sky for a brief moment before vanishing. Shortly after, he sees a three-legged crow and a mysterious hooded man who reveals himself to be Naomi from 10 years in the future, explaining that he has come to change an imminent tragic event that happens to Ruri shortly after they start dating. Initially taking his words with a grain of salt, present-day Naomi follows his future self&#x27;s instructions and starts getting closer to Ruri, determined to save her.

Hello World focuses on the present Naomi alongside himself from 10 years into the future. With the help of his future self, Naomi begins his preparations to save Ruri. Will he be able to change the future?</h4></div><div class="view_container" id="right"><img id="view_img" src="../review-images/hello_world_img.jpg"/></div></div><div class="view_container" id="mid"><h1 class="label">Review</h1><h4 class="view_review">This was and will always be the best romance movie, not anime, I've ever watched. The story where the MC discovers that he is actually living in a data world (No one calls it that only I do lmao) inside a database is so good to start with. Then the older or future MC comes and steals his girl lmao ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) rip MC. The girl gets stolen but soon brought back to her own world, it is a bit sad that the future MC died. Tho the plot twist in the end tho, we all thought that the girl (Ruri) <br><br><span class='markdown_attachment_ctn'><img class="markdown_attachment" src="../review-images/./ruri.jpg"></span><br> died because a lightning struck her, and thats what I thought happened in the real world as well. But NOPE, it was the MC who died, well not died but was unconcious for the whole time and it was his wife (which is also Ruri btw) who kept trying to bring him back, if you didn't notice this, the animation style in the movie (for the most part) was 3d but when the MC wakes up in his real world, the animation was in 2d as u can see this is<br>
<strong class='markdown_bold_text'>The 3D scenes:</strong> <br><br><span class='markdown_attachment_ctn'><img class="markdown_attachment" src="../review-images/./hello_world_3d.jpg"></span><br> <strong class='markdown_bold_text'>The Ending scene (2D)</strong>: <br><br><span class='markdown_attachment_ctn'><img class="markdown_attachment" src="../review-images/./hello_world_2d.jpg"></span><br> and Kai Tanaka commented this on the comments section of Hello world in AnimeDao

If you’ll look closely, you’ll notice that all the events of the “past” and “present-past” timelines involve 3-D animation, whereas, the events of the final “present timeline” have 2-D animation. This creates a contrast between the simulated and actual events of the anime’s storyline. Also, **since the movie is all about complex programming and its manipulation, its title alludes to the “Hello World” program which is often used to represent the basic syntax of a programming language**

Thats also a unique aspect about their animations and holy fuck I JUST DISCOVERED THERES A SEQUEL CALLED ANOTHER WORLD, I will watch it and update this when I am done


I have finished watching the sequel for it, and boy, not gonna lie I was dissapointed. I was hoping, since its a sequel, that they would make another movie or heck turn it into half season or full season anime but nope, all I saw was 3 OVAs showing how the MC spent his life after 10 years</h4></div></div><div class="view_comments"><h1>Comments</h1><div class="article-container"><div shortname="oniichann" config="[object Object]" id="disqus_thread"></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"hello world","rating":10,"review":"This was and will always be the best romance movie, not anime, I've ever watched.
