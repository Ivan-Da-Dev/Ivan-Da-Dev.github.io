{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"hello world","rating":10,"review":"This was and will always be the best romance movie, not anime, I've ever watched. The story where the MC discovers that he is actually living in a data world (No one calls it that only I do lmao) inside a database is so good to start with. Then the older or future MC comes and steals his girl lmao <lenny> rip MC. The girl gets stolen but soon brought back to her own world, it is a bit sad that the future MC died. Tho the plot twist in the end tho, we all thought that the girl (Ruri) @./ruri.jpg@ died because a lightning struck her, and thats what I thought happened in the real world as well. But NOPE, it was the MC who died, well not died but was unconcious for the whole time and it was his wife (which is also Ruri btw) who kept trying to bring him back, if you didn't notice this, the animation style in the movie (for the most part) was 3d but when the MC wakes up in his real world, the animation was in 2d as u can see this is\n\n**The 3D scenes:** @./hello_world_3d.jpg@ **The Ending scene (2D)**: @./hello_world_2d.jpg@ and Kai Tanaka commented this on the comments section of Hello world in AnimeDao\n\nIf you’ll look closely, you’ll notice that all the events of the “past” and “present-past” timelines involve 3-D animation, whereas, the events of the final “present timeline” have 2-D animation. This creates a contrast between the simulated and actual events of the anime’s storyline. Also, **since the movie is all about complex programming and its manipulation, its title alludes to the “Hello World” program which is often used to represent the basic syntax of a programming language**\n\nThats also a unique aspect about their animations and holy fuck I JUST DISCOVERED THERES A SEQUEL CALLED ANOTHER WORLD, I will watch it and update this when I am done\n\n\nI have finished watching the sequel for it, and boy, not gonna lie I was dissapointed. I was hoping, since its a sequel, that they would make another movie or heck turn it into half season or full season anime but nope, all I saw was 3 OVAs showing how the MC spent his life after 10 years","genres":["action","isekai","romance","science fiction"],"img":"hello_world_img.jpg","bg":"hello_world_bg.jpg","desc":"The year is 2027, and the city of Kyoto has undergone tremendous technological advancement.
