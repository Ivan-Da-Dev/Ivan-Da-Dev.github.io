{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"hidan no aria","rating":8,"review":"This was the first anime that I watched, it's pretty good. Aria is the reason I am obessed with 2d girls lmao @./aria.jpg@ and I also like how the MC is super op but he wants to lay low\n\nWhy did I give this anime a 8 and not a 9 or 10? Because it has a few plot holes, in season 1 they told us that the MC's brother died in a ship wreck tho he saved all the passengers but later on, Riko @./riko_mine.jpg@ says that his brother is her boyfriend and I was like wtf? Wasn't he dead? and that caught my interest even more. When I finished season 1, I watched season 2 despite being sleepy but only to be dissapointed, in season 2, they **COMPLETELY** changed the characters, they changed the MC as well. They add a new plot where a girl wants to be Aria's apprentice and wants to be cool like Aria. They completely forgotten about Shinji and his brother who never appeared (well Shinji did appear but for less than 10 minutes in the **whole** season), oh yeah, Shinji is the MC in season 1. This anime could've been a masterpiece but whoever decided to not peek into Shinji's past completely shitted on the anime","genres":["comedy","ecchi","romance","action"],"img":"hna_img.jpg","bg":"hna_bg.jpg","desc":"In response to the worsening crime rate, Japan creates Tokyo Butei High, an elite academy where \"Butei\" or armed detectives hone their deadly skills in hopes of becoming mercenary-like agents of justice.

Kinji now lives a life of leisure studying \nlogistics in order to cover up his powerful but embarrassing special ability. However, his peaceful days soon come to an end when he becomes the target of the infamous \"Butei Killer,\" and runs into an \nemotional hurricane and outspoken prodigy of the highest rank, Aria Holmes Kanzaki, who saves Kinji's life and demands that he become her partner after seeing what he is truly capable of.","alt":["Hidan no Aria"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
