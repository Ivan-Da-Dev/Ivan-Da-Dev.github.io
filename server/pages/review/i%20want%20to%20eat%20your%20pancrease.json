{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"i want to eat your pancrease","rating":2,"review":"Why did I gave it such a low rating? because it was boring and I didn't understand what the meaning of it was. Sakura mentioned that theres a rumor where if one of ur body's organs are failing or something, u eat that, for example, if ur stomach is broken, u eat a stomach\n\nThe anime is like SAO, it was good for 12 episodes, but it went downhill, wait, no. This anime wasn't good to begin with, the plot keeps telling us that Sakura was gonna die of her pancrease failing to work but in the end, surprise surprise, she gets murdered. \"...\" was what I thought when I saw that, well it didn't felt sad at all. If she was dying and the MC was besides her death bed, I would tear up a bit (probaly not) but instead they were like \"holy fuck it's been 1 hour 32 minutes, aight lets murder Sakura because we are running out of budget\"\n\nBet alot of people who cried at the movie will say my review is shit and that I should be the one dying and not Sakura but guess what, my reviews are shit tho I am still gonna live as healthy as Sakura","genres":["romance"],"img":"iwteyp_img.jpg","bg":"iwteyp_bg.jpg","desc":"The aloof protagonist: a bookworm who is deeply detached from the world he resides in. He has no interest in others and is firmly convinced that nobody has any interest in him either. His story begins when he stumbles across a handwritten book, titled \"Living with Dying.\" He soon identifies it as a secret diary belonging to his popular, bubbly classmate Sakura Yamauchi. She then confides \nin him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura's persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.\n\nAs the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day. Her apparent nonchalance and unpredictability disrupts the protagonist's impassive flow of life, gradually opening his heart as he discovers and embraces the true meaning of living.","alt":["KimiSui","Let Me Eat Your Pancreas"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
