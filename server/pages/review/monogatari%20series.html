Monogatari Series: Second Season revolves around these individuals and their struggle to overcome the darkness that is rapidly approaching. A new semester has begun and with graduation looming over Araragi, he must quickly decide the paths he will walk, as well as the relationships and friends that he&#x27;ll save. But as strange events begin to unfold, Araragi is nowhere to be found, and a vicious tiger apparition has appeared in his absence. Hanekawa has become its target, and she must fend for herself—or bow to the creature&#x27;s perspective on the feebleness of humanity.</h4></div><div class="view_container" id="right"><img id="view_img" src="../review-images/monogatari_img.jpg"/></div></div><div class="view_container" id="mid"><h1 class="label">Review</h1><h4 class="view_review">I started with kizumonogatari, meaning I watched the most brutal scenes among the monogatari series. If you started with kizumonogatari and dropped it because of the brutality, well you can ignore my opinion but you should keep continuing. The monogatari series isn't as brutal as kizu makes it look like. Its really interesting the way they animate and plan the timeline. The monogatari series is the best mystery anime imo, because they don't air the anime according to its plot's timeline, they would randomly air a season and then air another season on a completely different timeline as you can tell from each season's release date. Not only that but what makes it godly to me is the way they animate it, have you ever wondered what a anime with 98% text look like? Well that would be the monogatari series, not only does Araragi talk all the time, but they even add text flash scenes which look like this: <br><br><span class='markdown_attachment_ctn'><img class="markdown_attachment" src="../review-images/./monogatari_flash_scene.png"></span><br> that always irritates me because I would have to go back and pause the video to look what it said (altho I usually ignore them).
