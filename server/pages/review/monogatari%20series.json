If you started with kizumonogatari and dropped it because of the brutality, well you can ignore my opinion but you should keep continuing. The monogatari series isn't as brutal as kizu makes it look like. Its really interesting the way they animate and plan the timeline. The monogatari series is the best mystery anime imo, because they don't air the anime according to its plot's timeline, they would randomly air a season and then air another season on a completely different timeline as you can tell from each season's release date. Not only that but what makes it godly to me is the way they animate it, have you ever wondered what a anime with 98% text look like? Well that would be the monogatari series, not only does Araragi talk all the time, but they even add text flash scenes which look like this: @./monogatari_flash_scene.png@ that always irritates me because I would have to go back and pause the video to look what it said (altho I usually ignore them). Well in case you read this and you want to watch the monogatari series according to the order I watched, [press me to watch the monogatari series on a pirated anime website](https://animedao.to/anime/kizumonogatari/)","genres":["ecchi","comedy","adventure","mystery","psychological fiction"],"img":"monogatari_img.jpg","bg":"monogatari_bg.jpg","desc":"Apparitions, oddities, and gods continue to manifest around Koyomi Araragi and his close-knit group of friends: Tsubasa Hanekawa, the group's modest genius; Shinobu Oshino, the resident doughnut-loving vampire; athletic deviant Suruga Kanbaru; bite-happy spirit Mayoi Hachikuji; Koyomi's cutesy stalker Nadeko Sengoku; and Hitagi Senjogahara, the poignant tsundere.\n\nMonogatari Series: Second Season revolves around these individuals and their struggle to overcome the darkness that is rapidly approaching.
