{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"oreimo","rating":6,"review":"well....fuck I have to review this anime now\n\nOreimo was like SAO, it was good at the few episodes, I knew when watching episode 1 that it is heavily focused on incest. When starting at episode 1 I loved kirino because I am also a incest lover myself ya know <lenny>, everyone hated Kirino when I saw the comments section lmao, because of her attitude, tho I still liked her despite that. The first season was great, it introduced the characters, introduced the MC and Kirino's character development, but when I was near the ending at season 2, I see the MC rejects all off Kirino's friends who confessed to him and that includes Ayasake @./ayase.jpg@ and I was PISSED at the MC because Ayase is the 2nd best character in the anime, shes popular, cute, knows how to cook and doesn't have a shit attitude. Tho I can relate that the MC only has his eyes for Kirino, when I was watching the last episode, I was excited to see him and Kirino getting married, and they did have a wedding @./oreimo_wedding.jpg@ of course it was not a official wedding and no one attended the wedding either, why? Because they broke up after the wedding......\n\nThis is why I hate it, bruh MC u rejected 4 or 5 cute girls just to get married and break up after it? smh I'm still pissed at the MC","genres":["incest","comedy","romance","school"],"img":"oreimo_img.jpg","bg":"oreimo_bg.png","desc":"Kirino Kousaka embodies the ideal student with equally entrancing looks. Her grades are near perfect, and to cover her personal expenses, she works as a professional model alongside her best friend Ayase Aragaki, who abhors liars and all things otaku. But what Ayase doesn't know is that Kirino harbors a deep, entrenched secret that will soon be brought to light.\n\nAt home one day, Kyousuke, Kirino's perfectly average brother, stumbles upon an erotic game that belongs to none other than his seemingly flawless little sister. With her reputation at stake, Kirino places a gag order on her sibling while simultaneously introducing him to the world of eroge and anime. Through Kirino, Kyousuke encounters the gothic lolita Ruri Gokou and the bespectacled otaku Saori Makishima, thus jump-starting an entirely new lifestyle. But as he becomes more and more involved in his little sister's secret life, it becomes that much harder to keep under wraps. ","alt":["My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
