{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"plastic memories","rating":10,"review":"This anime is very good, its the first that make my cry like a little bitch lmao. I thought this was gonna be one of those happy ending animes but NOPE. \"What do u mean its sad? Didn't Isla came back to life at the end?\" no, remember that they mention they recycle used androids in order to save money? Yeah, they recycled (they removed her old memories and personality) Isla and gave tsukasa the recycled Isla, man thats even worse than Isla dying tbh. Why did this anime make me cry but I didn't cry when I watched \"A silent voice\"? Men, because this anime has 13 episodes (13 x 24 minutes = 312 minutes) while A silent voice was just 2 hours (120 minutes) long. Not only that but in a silent voice's ending, no one died while in plastic memories's ending, Isla died, well her old self died. And I wouldn't cry if it wasn't for Isla's last speech at the end, its so fucking sad and plus they added sad music in the background. This anime was rated a 10 because its the first and I hope it isn't the last anime to make me cry. It has a solid plot, solid characters and a good name","genres":["romance","drama","slice of life","science","sci-fi"],"img":"plamemo_img.png","bg":"plamemo_bg.jpg","desc":"Eighteen-year-old Tsukasa Mizugaki has failed his college entrance exams, but after pulling some strings, he manages to land a job at the Sion Artificial Intelligence Corporation. SAI Corp is responsible for the creation of \"Giftias\"â€”highly advanced androids which are almost indiscernible from normal humans. However, unlike humans, Giftias have a maximum lifespan of 81,920 hours, or around nine years and four months. Terminal Service One, the station Tsukasa was assigned to, is responsible for collecting Giftias that have met their expiration date, before they lose their memories and become hostile.\n\nPromptly after joining Terminal Service One, Tsukasa is partnered with a beautiful Giftia named Isla. She is a Terminal Service veteran and considered the best in Giftia retrievals, contrary to her petite figure and placid nature. Time is fleeting though, and Tsukasa must come to terms with his feelings for Isla before her time is up. No matter how much someone desires it, nothing lasts forever.","alt":["Plamemo"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
