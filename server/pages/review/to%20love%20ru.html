One day when sulking in the bathtub, a mysterious, naked devil-tailed girl appears out of nowhere. Her name is Lala Satalin Deviluke, the runaway crown princess of the planet Deviluke. Her father wants her to return home to marry one of her marriage candidates. When Devilukean commander Zastin arrives to bring her home, she swiftly declares she will marry Rito in order to stay on Earth, leading Zastin to attack Rito. But when Rito angrily declares that marriage is only possible with the person you love, the two dull-witted aliens misunderstand him, believing he truly understands Lala&#x27;s feelings.

Lala quickly falls in love with him, and Zastin also approves of their engagement, much to Rito&#x27;s dismay. While Zastin reports his support for the pair to Lala&#x27;s father, Gid Lucion Deviluke, who is the King of Deviluke and much of the known universe, Rito reluctantly helps Lala transition to life on Earth, while gradually befriending his dream girl, Haruna, along with a colorful cast of other girls (both humans and aliens), such as the uptight, high-strung girl Yui Kotegawa, the gender-switching alien Run/Ren, and the queen bee Saki Tenjouin, among others. In the meantime, Rito must also fight off Lala&#x27;s antagonistic alien suitors, one of whom sends the alien assassin Golden Darkness to kill him.</h4></div><div class="view_container" id="right"><img id="view_img" src="../review-images/tlr_img.jpg"/></div></div><div class="view_container" id="mid"><h1 class="label">Review</h1><h4 class="view_review">This anime was the first <strong class='markdown_bold_text'>nudity anime</strong> that I watched and its the best nudity anime I've ever watched up until now.
