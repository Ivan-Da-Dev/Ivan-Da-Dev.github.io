Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture.

One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki&#x27;s body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha&#x27;s life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another.

Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki&#x27;s actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other&#x27;s lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.</h4></div><div class="view_container" id="right"><img id="view_img" src="../review-images/your_name_img.jpg"/></div></div><div class="view_container" id="mid"><h1 class="label">Review</h1><h4 class="view_review">A lot of people said that this is a sad anime so I decided to watch it, and boy it wasn't sad at all. So basically what the movie is about is that theres a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha, he keeps getting his mind swapped with a girl named Mitsuha, this keeps continuing for a few months, they are from different time stamps, meh I'm too lazy to type the whole description, go view it on MAL or somewhere. Taki finds out that Mitsuha's village is gonna get crushed by a meteor, so to save Mitsuha, <strong class='markdown_bold_text'>he drinks sake and fucking time trvales back in time</strong> <span><img class="markdown_emoji" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/798246206706417704.png?v=1"></span>. Anyways, so Taki and Mitsuha both successfully saves Mitsuha's village by evacuting everyone to a place where the meteor won't hit. HOWEVER, since Mitsuha never died, this causes the butterfly effect, Taki never knew who Mitsuha is. But in the end they met when they were adults and Taki kinda recognizes Mitsuha and they lived happily ever after. Why did I rate it a 8? because it didn't make me cry like I expected it to be and hey, if it weren't for the music, I would've gave it a 5</h4></div></div><div class="view_comments"><h1>Comments</h1><div class="article-container"><div shortname="oniichann" config="[object Object]" id="disqus_thread"></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"your name","rating":8,"review":"A lot of people said that this is a sad anime so I decided to watch it, and boy it wasn't sad at all.
