{"pageProps":{"review":{"title":"your name","rating":8,"review":"A lot of people said that this is a sad anime so I decided to watch it, and boy it wasn't sad at all. So basically what the movie is about is that theres a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha, he keeps getting his mind swapped with a girl named Mitsuha, this keeps continuing for a few months, they are from different time stamps, meh I'm too lazy to type the whole description, go view it on MAL or somewhere. Taki finds out that Mitsuha's village is gonna get crushed by a meteor, so to save Mitsuha, **he drinks sake and fucking time trvales back in time** :woa:. Anyways, so Taki and Mitsuha both successfully saves Mitsuha's village by evacuting everyone to a place where the meteor won't hit. HOWEVER, since Mitsuha never died, this causes the butterfly effect, Taki never knew who Mitsuha is. But in the end they met when they were adults and Taki kinda recognizes Mitsuha and they lived happily ever after. Why did I rate it a 8? because it didn't make me cry like I expected it to be and hey, if it weren't for the music, I would've gave it a 5","genres":["romance"],"img":"your_name_img.jpg","bg":"your_name_bg.webp","desc":"Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl, yearns to live the life of a boy in the bustling city of Tokyo—a dream that stands in stark contrast to her present life in the countryside.
